Config Files
============

On one hand, there are all my config files, that can be openly visible and
should be shared across device, on the other there are the handy scripts to link
them.

* `setup.rb` creates symlinks from the original file to the one in this
  directory.
* `conf.rb` moves a configuration file into the directory and puts a link
  there instead.
